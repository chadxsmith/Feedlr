In 2013, Washington D.C.’s City Council passed legislation that would greatly limit food truck vending. With these new limits, the food truck dining experience would be bound to a few areas. In response, I lead a small team of engineers and designers set out to revolutionize Washington DC’s food truck industry. Our answer was Feedlr, a mobile application built to make food truck ordering a social experience.

My core responsibilities included:
- Interaction Design
- User Research (i.e. Survey Design, Task Analysis, Usability Testing)
- Visual Design
- User Experience Design
- Front-end Web Development 

The project concluded in 2014, due to limited interest from food truck owners
